# Create message cipher

How this cipher will work is it will alternate between hiding a coded message by randomly choosing a name from the .txt file based on the 2nd or 3rd letter

in the name.  Even words in the list will hide the message char in the second letter of the name and the odd words will hide it in the third letter of the

name.  Two null names will be introduced that will not be a part of the hidden message (Jacob & Stuart) and the first name in the list will not be a part of

the coded message as well.
